NOTES:
git clean -f will remove untracked files,meaning they're gone for good since they aren't stored in the repository.
Make sure you really want to remove all untracked files before doing this.
git reset --hard will not remove untracked files, 
where as git-clean will remove any files from the tracked root directory that are not under Git tracking.

Summary & note:

Get a repo from somewhere:
clone

Create a repo from scratch:
init

Work in linear fashion on the current branch:
add
commit
mv
rm

Work with branches themselves:
branch
checkout
merge

For working in and with branches:
reset

Get information about things:
log
status
diff
show

For syncing your repo to and from others:
fetch
pull
push

For searching history:
grep

For marking objects, typically commits:
tag

For being cool (most versioners can't even do these):
bisect
rebase

What is git rebase?
Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit.

Usage
The primary reason for rebasing is to maintain a linear project history.

pick (p for short) is the default action. In this case it would reapply the commit as is, no changes in its contents or message. Saving (and executing) this file would make no changes to the repository.

If I say reword (r for short) in a commit I want to edit:

pick 07c5abd Introduce OpenPGP and teach basic usage
pick de9b1eb Fix PostChecker::Post#urls
r 3e7ee36 Hey kids, stop all the highlighting
pick fa20af3 git interactive rebase, squash, amend
When I save and quit the editor, git will follow the described commands, landing myself into the editor again, as if I had amended commit 3e7ee36. I edit that commit message, save and quit the editor, and here is the output:

robots.thoughtbot.com tc-git-rebase % git rebase -i HEAD~4
[detached HEAD dd62a66] Stop all the highlighting

Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/tc-git-rebase.
Now Caleb says in his commit message “Stop all the highlighting”, whether you are a kid or not.

You should see a file displayed by your default editor. It should contain a list of commits made:

pick 07e03c2 add 2.txt
pick 5a71aa8 add 3.txt
pick d693749 add 4.txt
 
# Rebase 785d03b..d693749 onto 785d03b (3 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop = remove commit
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
NOTE: Commit ids such as “07e03c2” are a stand-in for whatever commit id Git creates for each specific commit.

Fixup or 'f' has the same combining effect as squash. Unlike squash, fixup commits will not interrupt rebase playback to open an editor to combine commit messages. The commits marked 'f' will have their messages discarded in-favor of the previous commit's message.

To properly understand git reset usage, we must first understand Git's internal state management systems. Sometimes these mechanisms are called Git's "three trees". 

To review, git reset is a powerful command that is used to undo local changes to the state of a Git repo. Git reset operates on "The Three Trees of Git". These trees are the Commit History ( HEAD ), the Staging Index, and the Working Directory. ... The options --soft, --mixed , and --hard can be passed to git reset .


git reset, moves both the HEAD and branch refs to the specified commit.
  
 
Attended few sessions on DevOps tool that is Ansible, myself went indepth about the tool and worked with which is an open source software that automates configuration management and application deployment that connects via SSH.
 
We use yaml scripting in Ansible playbooks where the script is written once and can be run on multiple servers at a time. Used for configuration mangement and appication deployments.

YAML, YAML Ain't Markup Language is a human-readable data serialization language.  Learned and wrote YAML scripts which are used in writing Ansible playbooks used for configuration management and application deployments.

The working directory
The Working Directory, this tree is in sync with the local filesystem i.e., the current set of files you’re working on in your file system.

Staging index
This tree is tracking Working Directory changes, that have been promoted with git add, to be stored in the next commit. This tree is a complex internal caching mechanism. Git generally tries to hide the implementation details of the Staging Index from the user.

Commit history
The final tree is the Commit History. The git commit command adds changes to a permanent snapshot that lives in the Commit History. This snapshot also includes the state of the Staging Index at the time of commit.

HEAD
This is an alias for the tip of the current branch, which is the most recent commit you have made to that branch.

when you do a git add, it stages the file in the index, and Git says “oh, okay, now your working copy and index match, but those are both different than HEAD.”

When you then perform a git commit, Git creates a new commit that HEAD now points to and the status of the index and working copy match it so Git’s happy once more.

Reset
If you just look at the reset command by itself, all it does is reset HEAD (the tip of the current branch) to another commit. For instance, say we have a branch (the name doesn’t matter, so let’s call this one “super-duper-feature”) and it looks like so:

If we perform:

> git reset HEAD

… nothing happens. This is because we tell git to reset this branch to HEAD, which is where it already is. But if we do:

> git reset HEAD~1

(HEAD~1 is shorthand case for “the commit right before HEAD”, or put differently “HEAD’s parent”) our branch now looks like so:

If we start at the latest commit again and do:

> git reset HEAD~2

our branch would look like so:

Again, all it does on a basic level is move HEAD to another commit.

git reset is similar in behavior to git checkout. 

Where git checkout solely operates on the HEAD ref pointer, git reset will move the HEAD ref pointer and the current branch ref pointer. To better demonstrate this behavior consider the following example:
